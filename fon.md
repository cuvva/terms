## How we'll use your data

### Insurance underwriting & anti-financial crime purposes

We'll use your data to look at the potential risk relating to your policy so we can:

- Give your driving licence number (DLN) to the DVLA, MyLicence or other relevant entities to confirm your licence status, entitlement and relevant restriction information and endorsement/conviction data. This also helps us to check your information to prevent fraud, and reduce incidents of negligent mis-representation and nondisclosure.
- Carrying out searches of your DLN against details held by the DVLA, MyLicence or other relevant entities. We do this to confirm your licence status, entitlement and restriction information and endorsement/conviction data. This helps us to check your information to prevent misuse and fraud.
- If youâ€™re using our Car Sharing feature to make or receive payments for lending or borrowing a vehicle, we will carry out checks against your bank account name, account number and sort code. This helps us to check your information to prevent money laundering and fraud.

Searches may be carried out against your DLN, name, date of birth, vehicle registration mark,  bank account details and postcode.

Searches may be carried out before the insurance policy is taken out - and at any point throughout the duration of your insurance policy or once it has ended. If you are only using our Car Sharing feature and not taking out an insurance policy, searches may be carried out before or after any Car Sharing payment has been made.

Searching your DLN with the DVLA, MyLicence or other relevant entities should not show a record against your driving licence.

## How your data will be processed

Your personal data will only be shared with organisations involved in the administration of your insurance policy, the processing of any Car Sharing payment, or as otherwise set out in our privacy notice.
