# Terms & conditions

**Why you should read these**

Please read these terms and conditions (**Terms**) carefully before you use Cuvva. They'll tell you who we are, how we provide products to you, how we might change these terms, how you or we could end our agreement to these terms, what to do if there's a problem and other important information.

If you think there's a mistake or anything needs amending, please get in touch. The best way to speak with us is usually in the app - or you can email us at [support@cuvva.com](mailto:support@cuvva.com).

## 1. General

These Terms are provided by Cuvva Limited (**Cuvva, we, our**) a company incorporated in England (no. 08907985) with registered office 12 Mallow Street, London, EC1Y 8RQ. We're authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority under number 690273. And we're registered with the Information Commissioner's Office under number ZA056769.

These Terms will be legally binding when you accept them. We'll make small changes from time-to-time, so come back and read these Terms now and again. We'll notify you by e-mail or by a notification in the app or website if we make material changes, so you can read and let us know if you accept the updated version.

## 2. Our Services

We're an independent insurance intermediary acting on your behalf to arrange either of two products (**Products**): short-term motor insurance (**Short-term**); and/or  travel insurance (**Travel**).

The Products are underwritten by insurance companies (**Insurers**), not Cuvva. To purchase a Product, you need to agree to a contract with the relevant Insurer (**Insurance Contract**). This will govern the terms and conditions on which the nominated vehicle is insured or individuals are insured.

**Cuvva doesn't provide personal recommendations or advice. Cuvva hasn't carried out an analysis of the market to identify the best possible offer for you.** You'll need to make your own choice on whether the product is suitable for your needs.

Our Short-term and Travel products are each provided by a single insurer on a non-exclusive basis. Details of the relevant Insurer can be found within your Insurance Contract prior to purchasing either Product, and/or are available on request.

Currently it's not possible to purchase our Products when outside the UK.

## 3. Your Protection

Cuvva Limited is authorised and regulated by the FCA, as we described earlier. We're permitted to arrange non-investment general insurance contracts. You can check this information on the FCA's Register by visiting [www.fca.org.uk/register](https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/financial-services-register) or by contacting the FCA on [0800 111 6768](tel:08001116768).

Cuvva is responsible for arranging and administering our Products. As part of this service, it's our intention to provide you with an exceptional level of customer support at all times. But if you're unhappy with Cuvva, we have a formal complaints procedure. You can contact us via the app or by e-mail at [support@cuvva.com](mailto:support@cuvva.com). Alternatively, you can write to us at 12 Mallow Street, London, EC1Y 8RQ.

The Insurers are responsible for the underlying insurance policy and related claims. If you're unhappy with the Insurers, you can contact them directly. If you need any further information, please refer to your Insurance Contract or get in touch with us.

If you remain unhappy with either Cuvva or our Insurers, you're entitled to refer your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service at any time and free of charge. You can find out more here: [http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/publications/consumer-leaflet.htm](http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/publications/consumer-leaflet.htm).

We're also covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). You may be entitled to compensation from the FSCS in the unlikely event we can't meet our obligations. Further information about the compensation scheme arrangement is available here: [https://fscs.org.uk/your-claim](https://fscs.org.uk/your-claim)

## 4. Information about the Insurers and Purchasing Process

All transactions to purchase Products are completed via our app. Prior to payment you'll be given a quote which will be valid for a limited period as shown in our app. You should only proceed to the payment screen and then authorise payment if you accept the quote, the Terms and the Insurance Contract, and wish Cuvva to collect money from you.

After you authorise payment, we may carry out final checks which can result in a failed purchase. If this happens and results in an uncaptured payment, we'll automatically release the payment within a few minutes. But it may take up to 7 days to be processed by your bank.

Before purchasing Products via our app, you should read the relevant Insurance Contract with the Insurer, which is provided within the app. The Insurance Contract covers any terms and conditions between you and the Insurer (whereas these Terms are between you and Cuvva).

**You can only use our app to purchase motor insurance for yourself.** You can't purchase motor insurance on behalf of another person. If you represent yourself as another person to apply for motor insurance Product, the Product may not be valid.

You can use our app to purchase travel insurance for a companion joining you on your trip, provided you have their consent, subject to the limitations set out during the purchasing journey.

You must not pay for our services using a payment card in someone else's name. You should only use a payment card which is in your name.

If you use a payment card which isn't in your name, we may take appropriate action. That could mean a block on your account. If an account holder requests a chargeback, we reserve the right to charge you reasonable costs.

Once you've purchased a Short-term product, we can't make any changes to it. So you wouldn't be able to change your cover to another vehicle, for example. If you wanted to cover a different vehicle, you would need to get a new quote in the app, before purchasing a new Short-term product.

Cuvva can't guarantee that our app will be available at all times, including due to problems with third party websites or your internet connectivity.  Cuvva will not be responsible to you for any losses or inconvenience as a result of our app being unavailable.

## 5. Your Responsibility for Accurate information

In the case of all insurance, the validity of cover and the amount you pay depends on the information you provide. **It's your responsibility to provide complete and accurate information to us and the Insurer at all times**, including when you purchase your Product. It's important that all statements you make and all questions you answer are complete, true and accurate.

You must notify us of anything which may affect the Product, insurance policy or quote. For Short-term, this could mean telling us about any previous incidents you've been involved in, or if there's any reason you may not be able to legally drive the vehicle. For travel, this could be any health issues, or anything you're aware of which may mean you won't be able to make the trip.

You can update your details yourself or speak with us in the app, by e-mail, or in writing. All communications are recorded - see our Privacy Notice for more information.

If you're not sure whether you need to tell us something - please ask. We're happy to help!

If the information provided by you is not complete and accurate:

- The insurance policy may be voided by the Insurer, meaning the insurance policy effectively never existed and, if using our Short-term product, you may be liable for driving without insurance.
- The insurance policy may be cancelled by the Insurer, meaning the Insurer can refuse to pay a claim, or may not pay a claim in full.
- The Insurer may require you pay additional premiums, change the compulsory excess, or the extent of the cover may be affected to reflect the increased insurance risk.
- If using our Short-term product, you may be responsible for damage or loss to a third party if you cause an accident.

**Further details of the Insurer's rights are set out in the Insurance Contract.**

We won't be responsible for any loss, damage or otherwise that results from you not having not provided complete and accurate information, unless it would be illegal for us to exclude or attempt to exclude our responsibility to you.

## 6. Cancellation

If you purchase our Products, the details of your cancellation rights are included in the relevant Insurance Contract. **In most cases, due to the rules governing short-term insurance, once the Short-term Product is active you no longer have a right to receive a refund.**

**Your Insurance Contract will include a cancellation clause for the Insurer in certain circumstances. You should ensure you understand when this might happen before you enter into the Insurance Contract.**

## 7. How we get paid

For all Products, you'll be advised of the insurance premiums, taxes and fees payable in our quote summary which you can see in the app prior to purchase. Cuvva Limited is usually paid either by receiving a percentage of the insurance premium by way of commission from the Insurer or service provider, or by receiving an admin fee from you for arranging the insurance, or both. We may earn additional amounts from Insurers to reflect the performance of the Products.

All commissions, taxes and fees are disclosed in our app, or available from us on request.

## 8. Correspondence

Prior to purchasing your Product you'll be able to review the Insurance Contract in long format. Depending on the Product, you may also receive a summary (**Key Facts Document**). Following purchase you'll receive an email with your Insurance Certificate and Insurance Contract relating to your policy. The email will also include a breakdown of what you've paid and some other useful information, like how to contact us if you have an accident. These documents are also visible within the app.

We may need to contact you from time-to-time, usually by e-mail or in the app. It's important you read any messages sent to you and respond in a timely fashion when necessary. Please be aware that we may require certain information from you on behalf of our Insurers, and failure to provide such information can result in the cancellation of an existing policy and/or not being allowed to purchase future policies. Any such action will be taken in accordance with the terms of your Insurance Contract.

It's important to ensure the details of any vehicle you want to insure match the details you enter in the app. Failure to do so can lead to you getting insured on the wrong vehicle! Please also check that the details we provide you about the vehicle, prior to purchase, match the vehicle you wish to drive.

## 9. Motor Insurance Database

All UK car insurance policies are automatically added to the "Motor Insurance Database" which is used by the police and ANPR cameras to confirm cars are driving legally. Although Cuvva sends information to the MID faster than other companies, unfortunately, the database is slow to update and it's possible your policy will have expired before it shows up on the MID.

Your policy documents (found in app or by e-mail) are proof of your cover and if there are any questions from the authorities, they can do a live check or get in touch with Cuvva. Please ensure that any authorities double-check your policy documents and if there's any doubt, they should contact Cuvva. Once your car is impounded you typically have to pay a high fee for the vehicle's release.

## 10. Authentication

Please keep your phone security details safe and confidential - tell us immediately if you think someone else may have accessed the Cuvva App using them.

**If you don't keep your phone security details safe and confidential, and/or you allow another person to access the app using them, and another person uses your phone to purchase a Product, Cuvva will not be obliged to refund you for that Product.**

In order to verify that your card details are active we may charge a small nominal amount (for example £1.00) to your card or account, this will be released back to you within 7 days (this is sometimes known as an "active card check"). This may still happen if the card verification fails, and can happen more than once if you add the card multiple times.

## 11. Claims and incident reporting

Claims should be notified to the Insurer as soon as possible. If you don't, an Insurer may refuse to deal with your claim or reduce the amount you receive from them - Cuvva can't intervene with the Insurer on your behalf. In the event an Insurer becomes insolvent or delays making settlement, we don't accept responsibility for paying any unpaid amounts owed to you.

## 12. Termination

We reserve the right to resign as your insurance intermediary at any time. We may issue a warning, temporarily suspend, permanently suspend or terminate your right to use the Cuvva App at any time, including, but not limited to, if you breach any of these Terms; infringe or violate or attempt to infringe or violate any rights of third parties (including other users of the Cuvva App); if you're using a Product outside its intended application; or if we suspect you're using the Cuvva App to commit or attempt to commit a criminal offence. If we suspend or terminate your access, we'll continue to fulfil any outstanding regulatory responsibilities to you following our termination of these Terms.

## 13. If things go wrong

We understand that we may have responsibilities in the event of our negligence, and don't attempt to restrict or exclude our responsibility. 

We don't accept any responsibility for any loss or damage you may incur as a result of the acts or omissions of your Insurer.

If we don't meet our obligations under these Terms due to events outside of our control, such as machine failure, industrial disputes or because we have to keep to a relevant law, we won't be responsible for any losses or costs caused.

## 14. Your Instructions

Usually all communications are made via the app, but we may also contact you by e-mail, letter, telephone or face-to-face. We can't guarantee your instructions have been received unless we've acknowledged them. We reserve the right to refuse instructions but, if we do, we'll let you know.

Our office hours are Monday to Friday, 9.00am to 6.00pm UK time. There may be a delay in responding to instructions if they're received outside of office hours. But you can speak with us in the app 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

## 15. Privacy Notice

You can find details of how we treat the information you provide to us (including personal information) in our Privacy Notice, which you can find in our app.

## 16. Money Laundering &amp; Proceeds of Crime

We're obliged to report to the Serious Organised Crime Agency any suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing activity. We may be prohibited from disclosing to you the contents of such report or the fact that such a report has been made.

## 17. Third Party Rights

This contract is between you and us. Nothing in these Terms will give someone who isn't party to the contract any right to enforce any of these Terms. We won't need the agreement of someone who isn't party to the contract in order to end the contract or make any changes to these Terms.

## 18. Severability

If any part of these Terms is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable then that part will be considered to be removed from these Terms. It won't affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the remaining Terms.

## 19. Waiver

Our failure or delay in enforcing or partially enforcing any provision of the Terms won't be construed as a waiver of any of our rights under the Terms. This means that if we don't insist immediately that you do anything you're required to do under these Terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that won't mean you don't have to do those things, and it won't prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.

## 20. Use of the Cuvva App

By using the Cuvva App you agree that you're solely responsible for ensuring you have permission to use any relevant vehicle to which the Product relates. Cuvva has no control and takes no responsibility for the relevant vehicle.

## 21. Insurer solvency

We don't guarantee the solvency of any insurer we help arrange your purchase Products from. An insolvent Insurer may be unable to pay a proportion or all of any claim made. If an Insurer becomes insolvent you may need to pay a further premium to pay for alternative insurance cover. In the event an Insurer becomes insolvent, we'll let you know as soon as we can and help as best we can.

## 22. Law and jurisdiction

The laws of England and Wales apply to our service. Any disputes are intended to be heard by the Courts of England and Wales. But we recognise you're free to choose the laws and jurisdiction of Scotland, or Northern Ireland, if you're resident there and wish to do so.
